# Battle Tanks
---
This repository houses my game project for a third person tank fighting game Battle Tanks. I started the creation of this game during my course at Udemy - "The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ & Make Games", found [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubDiscount), led by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi.

## Technical information
The game has been created with UnrealEngine 4.15.1 and VisualStudio 2015. It is written mainly in C++ but I also have taken advantage of the blueprint system for the UI and player movement controls mapping. 

## The Game
The game is played from a third person perspective. The player controls a tank and the goal is for the player to kill all enemies present on the map. For this he can use the terrain as an advantage or to manuver in a way that the enemy NPC can't hit him.
