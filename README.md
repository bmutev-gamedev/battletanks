# Building Escape
---
This repository houses my game project for a puzzle type game Building Escape. This game was started during my course at Udemy - "The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ & Make Games", found [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubDiscount), led by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi. Later I have built upon it a bit and as of now this is not yet a full fledget game. It is missing quite a bit of things such as a game menu, an options menu, more levels, atleast a basic multiplayer and so on.

## Technical information
The game has been created with UnrealEngine 4.15.1 and VisualStudio 2015. It is written mainly in C++ but I also have taken advantage of the blueprint system for the UI and player movement controls mapping. 

## The Game
The game is played from a third person perspective. The player controls a tanks and the goal is for the player to kill all enemies present on the map. For this he can use the terrain hills as an advantage or to manuver in a way that the enemy NPC can't hit him.
